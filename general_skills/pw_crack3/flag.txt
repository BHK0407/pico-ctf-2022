Solution 

just move the pow_pw_list on the begin of function level_3_pw_check():

then make sure the password we choose is in the range so, it should be like:

def level_3_pw_check():
    pos_pw_list = ["6997", "3ac8", "f0ac", "4b17", "ec27", "4e66", "865e"]
    for i in range(0, len(pos_pw_list)):
        #user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
        user_pw = pos_pw_list[i]
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
    
        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
            print(decryption)
            return
        print("That password is incorrect")



level_3_pw_check()
