first get the file

then use quipquip.com to decrypt

we found that in the end of the paragraph:

picoCTF{ n r m ny due a} ===> (1)

comapre with the ascii file we have before "message.txt": 


{G6D4U_4G41T515_15_73Y10A5_42JX1770} (2)



So one is the group of characters that we can use to change in the (2) order by level

For example : G ===> n; D ===> r, ...





===> picoCTF{n6r4m_4n41y515_15_73d10u5_42ea1770}
