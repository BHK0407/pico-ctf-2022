So the trick of this is look at the script from "game-redacted.c"


It means we need to win 5 times of the game

but the tricks in there is when look at the script:


"


  int computer_turn = rand() % 3;
  printf("You played: %s\n", player_turn);
  printf("The computer played: %s\n", hands[computer_turn]);

  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
  } else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
  }
}

"

---> so trick here is it will take a couple of thing we try to do 
===> solution is : rockpaperscissors * 5 times
